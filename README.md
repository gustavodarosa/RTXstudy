# RTX Simulation

## Overview
The RTX Simulation project is designed to simulate the behavior of an RTX system. It provides a framework for initializing, running, and managing the simulation, along with utility functions for performance metrics and logging.

## Project Structure
```
rtx-simulation
├── src
│   ├── index.js          # Entry point of the application
│   ├── simulation
│   │   └── rtx.js       # Contains the RTXSimulation class
│   └── utils
│       └── helpers.js    # Utility functions for the simulation
├── package.json          # npm configuration file
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rtx-simulation
npm install
```

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the following command:

```bash
node src/index.js
```

## API
### RTXSimulation Class
The `RTXSimulation` class provides the following methods:

- `startSimulation()`: Initializes and starts the simulation.
- `stopSimulation()`: Stops the ongoing simulation.
- `updateState(state)`: Updates the current state of the simulation.

### Utility Functions
The project includes utility functions in `helpers.js`:

- `calculatePerformance(data)`: Calculates and returns performance metrics based on the provided data.
- `logEvent(event)`: Logs events that occur during the simulation for tracking and debugging purposes.
